# Project Overview
The project uses data from Swiggy's food delivery platform to analyze key metrices such as order volume, delivery time, customer ratings and restaurant ratings. The analysis can be used to improve the service provided by Swiggy to customers and restaurants and to help in making data-driven decisions. This repository contains in-depth analysis of Swiggy using Advanced Excel.

# Key Findings
- **Traffic Analysis**: Significant fluctuations in traffic were observed throughout the year, with notable peaks during major festivals and promotional campaigns. Conversely, dips in traffic were often linked to technical issues or increased competition.
- **Order Levels**: Order levels generally mirrored traffic trends, with spikes during high-traffic periods and declines when traffic dropped. However, other factors like average delivery charges, discounts, and out-of-stock items also had a substantial impact on order volumes.
- **Conversion Rates**: The analysis revealed that conversion rates from different stages of the funnel (e.g., from menu to cart, cart to payment) were highly sensitive to factors such as pricing, discounts, and technical issues.
